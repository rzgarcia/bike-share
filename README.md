# bike-share

Using Python, including NumPy and Pandas, to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States -  Chicago, New York City and Washington DC. 

The analysis is mainly focused on :
* computing the most popular month / day of the week / start hour;
* displaying statistics on the most common station and trip (combination of the start and end stations);
* calculating the total and the average trip duration;
* understanding statistics on bike share users, such as their type, gender and year of birth.
